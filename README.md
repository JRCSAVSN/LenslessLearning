# Learning for lensless mask-based Imaging

### [Project Page](https://waller-lab.github.io/LenslessLearning)
This code is based on the paper: "Learned reconstructions for practical
mask-based lensless imaging" available here: link coming soon


### Loading in in the models
You can find a jupyter notebook that loads in the pre-trained models and runs reconstructions on sample lensless images [here](https://github.com/Waller-Lab/LenslessLearning/blob/master/pre-trained%20reconstructions.ipynb) 

The pre-trained models can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/file/d/1aIgWXVt_najoS5ccBglJLEC3WYSFSRX8/view?usp=sharing)
